This is a fairly small mod made by myself. It is largely based off the game Spiral Knights, an MMO I used to play years ago. 
This mod adds an assortment of weapons - mostly bombs, swords and blasters. 
It also adds a few new enemies to the earlygame and a couple of melee armour sets.
The mod gives you enough content to do a whole playthrough solely focused on its weapons.

Beta 0.1.34 - First release.
As this is the first public release please note it may not be well balanced.
If you experience any issues or see places for improvement in balance please let me know.
Not yet tested with other mods, so please let me know!
Please also test multiplayer.
